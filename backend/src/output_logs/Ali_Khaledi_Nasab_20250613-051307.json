      "data": "Ali Khaledi Nasab has contributed to several AI-related research areas, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, networks, computational neuroscience, and nonlinear dynamics. His work encompasses a range of topics, from the synthesis of nanoparticles using green methods to the study of collective dynamics in excitable networks.\n\nIn the field of nanotechnology, Khaledi Nasab co-authored a study titled \"Potato extract as reducing agent and stabiliser in a facile green one-step synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles,\" published in the *Journal of Experimental Nanoscience* in 2016. This research explores an eco-friendly approach to synthesizing zinc oxide nanoparticles, highlighting the potential of using natural extracts as reducing agents and stabilizers in nanoparticle production. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nIn computational neuroscience, he has investigated the collective dynamics of excitable networks. One of his notable works is \"Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks of excitable elements,\" published in *Scientific Reports* in 2017. This study examines how random tree networks of excitable elements can exhibit emergent stochastic oscillations, providing insights into signal detection mechanisms in complex systems. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, Khaledi Nasab has engaged in discussions on the societal impacts of political decisions on international students. In 2017, he authored an article titled \"Standing up to fear,\" published in *Science*. The piece reflects on the challenges faced by international students in the U.S. following the Trump administration's travel ban, emphasizing the need for institutional support and solidarity.
