He earned his Ph.D. in Physics & Astronomy from Ohio University, where he focused on the dynamics of excitable tree networks, particularly in sensory neurons with myelinated dendrites. His doctoral research was supervised by Dr. Alexander Neiman. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nFollowing his Ph.D., Dr. Khaledi Nasab joined Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery as a postdoctoral researcher. At Stanford, he worked with Dr. Peter Tass on designing stimulation methods for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease. His research aimed to improve the efficacy of coordinated reset stimulation by developing new stimulation techniques. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2022, Dr. Khaledi Nasab transitioned to the private sector, joining Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a research scientist in the Network Capacity Planning organization. Concurrently, he initiated independent research projects, referred to as \"night science,\" focusing on problems at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. One of his notable publications from this endeavor is \"Depolarization of echo chambers by random dynamical nudge,\" published in Scientific Reports in 2022. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Khaledi Nasab has demonstrated a commitment to interdisciplinary research, leveraging computational methods to address complex problems in physics, neuroscience, and beyond.
