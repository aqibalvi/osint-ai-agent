      "data": "Ali Khaledi-Nasab is a physicist and AI scientist currently working at Amazon Rufus, focusing on generative AI products. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai)) He holds a Ph.D. in physics from Ohio University, where his research centered on the collective dynamics of excitable tree networks. Following his doctoral studies, he conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery, developing stimulation methods for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2022, Khaledi-Nasab joined Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a research scientist in the Network Capacity Planning organization. By 2024, he transitioned to Amazon Rufus to work on generative AI products. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai)) His research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, networks, computational neuroscience, and nonlinear dynamics. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nOne of his notable publications is \"Depolarization of echo chambers by random dynamical nudge,\" published in *Scientific Reports* in 2022. This study explores methods to reduce polarization in social networks through random dynamical interventions. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nKhaledi-Nasab's interdisciplinary background in physics, neuroscience, and AI positions him at the forefront of developing innovative AI solutions, particularly in the realm of generative AI.
