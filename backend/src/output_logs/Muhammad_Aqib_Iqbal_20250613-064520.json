Academic / Public Presence**\n\n* No academic profiles specifically for \"Muhammad Aqib Iqbal\" in AI/Quality Engineering fields\n* Several researchers with similar names identified:\n  - Muhammad Iqbal (AD Scientific Index)⁴ - different individual\n  - Saqib Iqbal, Ph.D at Al Ain University⁵ - different individual\n  - GM Iqbal Mahmud⁶ - different individual with AI publications\n\n**5. Online / Social Media**\n\n* Codester profile shows one Android app template (\"Red Pro VPN\")²\n* No verified social media presence connected to Oman or Turing.com\n* No evidence of conference speaking engagements in Oman⁷\n\n**6. Additional Observations**\n\n* Articles about Aqib Ilyas (Omani cricket captain)⁸ represent a different individual\n* The commonality of the name creates significant challenges in verification\n* Limited digital footprint suggests either low public profile or use of alternative names\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\n**Risk Score: Low**\n\nThe available evidence indicates minimal public presence and no concerning activities. The individual appears to be a Pakistan-based developer with no significant ties to Oman.\n\n### Investigation Limitations\n\n1. **Name commonality**: Multiple individuals share similar names, creating attribution challenges\n2. **Geographic disconnect**: Subject appears Pakistan-based, limiting Oman-specific intelligence\n3. **Limited digital footprint**: Minimal verifiable online presence beyond developer platforms\n4. **No direct Turing.com connection**: Unable to verify claimed employment\n\n### Recommendations\n\n* Additional verification needed if Oman-specific activities are suspected\n* Direct contact or official documentation may be required for positive identification\n* Monitor for any emerging connections to Omani entities\n\n---\n\n### Citations\n\n¹ RemoteHub Profile: https://www.remotehub.com/muhammad.aqib.1\n² Codester Profile: https://www.codester.com/Aqibofficial\n³ Decypha - Mohammed Iqbal: https://www.decypha.com/en/people-list/Mohammed-Iqbal-340125\n⁴ AD Scientific Index: https://www.adscientificindex.com/scientist/muhammad-iqbal/4556159\n⁵ Al Ain University: https://www.engineering.aau.ac.ae/en/academic-staff/staff/saqib-iqbal/researches\n⁶ GM Iqbal Publications: https://gmiqbal.github.io/_pages/publications-data/\n⁷ ICIB Speakers: https://icib.riphah.edu.pk/speakers/\n⁸ Times of Oman: https://cdn-2.timesofoman.com/article/145028-ilyas-to-lead-oman-at-t20-world-cup"
