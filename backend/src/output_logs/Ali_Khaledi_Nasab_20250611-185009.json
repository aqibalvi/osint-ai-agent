      "data": "Ali Khaledi Nasab is a physicist and AI scientist currently serving as a Senior Manager and Applied Scientist in AI at Amazon's Worldwide Sustainability (WWS) organization in Seattle, Washington. In this role, he drives technical strategy and innovation for Amazon's long-term sustainability and climate commitments through AI and machine learning. ([amazon.science](https://www.amazon.science/author/ali-khaledi?utm_source=openai))\n\nOriginally from Iran, Dr. Khaledi moved to the United States in 2014 to pursue his Ph.D. in Physics at Ohio University. His doctoral research focused on the collective dynamics of excitable tree networks, particularly in sensory neurons with myelinated dendrites. Following his Ph.D., he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery, where he developed stimulation methods for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2021, Dr. Khaledi joined CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. However, due to unfavorable economic conditions in 2022, CODA was unable to secure additional funding and ceased operations. Subsequently, he transitioned to Amazon in October 2022 as a research scientist in the AWS Network Capacity Planning organization. In 2024, he moved to Amazon's Worldwide Sustainability team to work on generative AI products. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Khaledi has been committed to continuous learning and professional development. He dedicates time daily to reading and taking courses, aligning with Amazon's core leadership principle of \"Learn and Be Curious.\" ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDr. Khaledi has also contributed to the scientific community through publications and presentations. In 2019, he received an American Physical Society (APS) Division of Biological Physics Student Travel Award to attend the annual APS meeting in Boston, where he presented his research on the dynamics of excitable tree networks. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2019/05/khaledi-nasab-receives-aps-travel-award-to-attend-conference/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, he has shared his insights on career development through articles on Medium, such as \"An Introduction to a Successful Job Interview,\" reflecting his dedication to mentoring and guiding others in the scientific community. ([ali-khaledi1989.medium.com](https://ali-khaledi1989.medium.com/an-introduction-to-a-successful-job-interview-b4925c49d98?utm_source=openai))\n\nDr. Khaledi's diverse experiences in physics, neuroscience, and AI, combined with his commitment to sustainability, position him as a leader in applying scientific innovation to address global challenges.
