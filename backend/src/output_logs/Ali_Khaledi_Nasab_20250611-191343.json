His contributions have been recognized in several academic settings.\n\nIn 2019, Khaledi Nasab received the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Biological Physics Student Travel Award, which supported his attendance at the APS annual meeting in Boston. During this conference, he presented his paper titled \"Dynamics of excitable tree networks: Application to sensory neurons.\" His research focused on understanding the dynamical principles of functioning and information processing in sensory neurons with tree-like structures. He utilized theoretical and computational approaches to explore mechanisms of spike generation and information coding in these neurons.

His presentation, titled \"Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks of excitable elements,\" delved into the stochastic dynamics of tree networks of excitable elements, relevant to certain sensory neurons like cat muscle spindles. He demonstrated that the spontaneous activity of the network could be predicted by examining a single effective node with scaled parameters, suggesting a mechanism for tuning the activity of the central element in the tree network.
