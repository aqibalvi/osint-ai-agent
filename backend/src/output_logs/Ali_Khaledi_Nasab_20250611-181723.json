His work aims to understand the principles of functioning and information processing in these neurons, which are crucial for various sensory functions.\n\nIn 2019, Khaledi Nasab received the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Biological Physics Student Travel Award. This grant supported his attendance at the annual APS meeting in Boston, where he presented his paper titled \"Dynamics of excitable tree networks: Application to sensory neurons.\" His research utilized theoretical and computational approaches to explore mechanisms of spike generation and information coding in sensory neurons with tree-like myelinated terminals.

His presentation, \"Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks of excitable elements,\" delved into the stochastic dynamics of tree networks of excitable elements, relevant to sensory neurons like cat muscle spindles. The study suggested that the spontaneous activity of these networks could be predicted by examining a single effective node with scaled parameters, offering insights into tuning the activity of central elements in tree networks.

However, a search for similar names reveals individuals with the surname \"Kharazmi\" involved in business activities.\n\nFor instance, in the 2016 10-K filing of NuGene International, Inc., the company's Chairman of the Board is Mohammad Ali Kharazmi, and the Acting Chief Financial Officer and Board Member is Mohammad Saeed Kharazmi. The filing discusses a lawsuit involving Advanced Surgical Partners, LLC, which names NuGene, Inc., and the Kharazmi brothers as defendants. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1593549/000161577417001634/s105503_10k.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the 2006 S-1 filing for U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc. mentions individuals named Khazani, Nia, and Elyashar, who are associated with the company and its subsidiaries. While the surname differs, the phonetic similarity to \"Kharazmi\" is notable. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1378950/000119312506221797/ds1.htm?utm_source=openai))\n\nIt's important to note that \"Kharazmi\" is a common surname in Iran, and individuals with this name are involved in various business activities. However, without more specific information, it's challenging to establish a direct connection to an individual named Ali Khaledi Nasab. ",
