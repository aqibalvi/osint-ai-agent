Originally from Iran, he moved to the U.S. in 2014 to pursue his Ph.D. He completed his doctoral studies in Physics and Astronomy at Ohio University, focusing on the dynamics of excitable tree networks in sensory neurons. His research aimed to understand the functioning and information processing in these neurons, with applications to sensory systems like muscle spindles and pain receptors. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2019/05/khaledi-nasab-receives-aps-travel-award-to-attend-conference/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAfter earning his Ph.D., Khaledi Nasab joined Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery as a postdoctoral researcher. There, he worked on developing stimulation methods for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, by designing new stimulation techniques to improve the efficacy of treatments like Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/about?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2021, he transitioned to a role at CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. However, due to unfavorable economic conditions in 2022, CODA was unable to secure the necessary funding to advance its research to the clinical stage and had to close its doors. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nFollowing this, Khaledi Nasab joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team. His background in physics and neuroscience, combined with his expertise in machine learning and deep learning, has enabled him to contribute to Amazon's advancements in AI and network capacity planning. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThroughout his career, Khaledi Nasab has been committed to continuous learning and professional development. He dedicates time daily to reading and taking courses, aligning with Amazon's core leadership principle of \"Learn and Be Curious.\" ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn addition to his professional work, Khaledi Nasab has been active in addressing challenges faced by international students. In 2017, he authored an article titled \"Standing up to fear,\" discussing the impact of U.S. immigration policies on international scholars and advocating for support and inclusion within academic institutions. ([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32689067/Standing_up_to_fear?utm_source=openai))\n\nOverall, Ali Khaledi Nasab's career reflects a strong dedication to scientific research, technological innovation, and advocacy for international scholars.
