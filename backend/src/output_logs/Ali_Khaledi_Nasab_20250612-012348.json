In 2024, he transitioned to Amazon Rufus to work on the company's latest Generative AI product. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nBefore his tenure at Amazon, Dr. Khaledi Nasab earned his Ph.D. in Physics from Ohio University, where he focused on the collective dynamics of excitable tree networks. His research aimed to understand the functioning and information processing in sensory neurons with tree-like structures. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2019/05/khaledi-nasab-receives-aps-travel-award-to-attend-conference/?utm_source=openai))\n\nFollowing his doctoral studies, he worked at Stanford University School of Medicine's Department of Neurosurgery, collaborating with Dr. Peter Tass on developing stimulation methods for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease. He also joined CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. However, due to unfavorable economic conditions in 2022, CODA was unable to secure the necessary funding and had to close its doors. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn addition to his professional roles, Dr. Khaledi Nasab has been active in academia, publishing research on topics such as the depolarization of echo chambers through random dynamical nudges. He has also contributed to the Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health, serving as the editor for the Brain Development section. This collaborative work received the 2024 PROSE Award for \"significant contributions\" in Clinical Medicine by the Association of American Publishers. ([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDr. Khaledi Nasab's diverse background in physics, neuroscience, and AI underscores his commitment to advancing scientific understanding and developing innovative solutions in the field of artificial intelligence.
