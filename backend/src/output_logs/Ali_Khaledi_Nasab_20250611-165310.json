His work has been recognized in various academic settings.\n\nIn October 2017, as a graduate student in Physics & Astronomy at Ohio University, Khaledi Nasab delivered a colloquium talk at the College of Wooster. His presentation, titled \"Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks of excitable elements,\" focused on the dynamics of tree-like networks of excitable elements, relevant to sensory neurons such as those in cat muscle spindles. He utilized biophysical models to study the stochastic behavior of these networks, suggesting mechanisms for tuning the activity of central elements within the tree network. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2017/10/khaledi-nasab-gives-colloquium-talk-college-wooster/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn March 2019, Khaledi Nasab received the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Biological Physics 2019 Student Travel Award, which supported his attendance at the annual APS meeting in Boston. During this conference, he presented his paper titled \"Dynamics of excitable tree networks: Application to sensory neurons.\" His research aimed to understand the dynamical principles of functioning and information processing in sensory neurons with tree-like morphologies, such as those found in muscle spindles and pain receptors. He employed theoretical and computational approaches to explore mechanisms of spike generation and information coding in these neurons. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2019/05/khaledi-nasab-receives-aps-travel-award-to-attend-conference/?utm_source=openai))\n\nRegarding recent conferences or symposiums featuring Khaledi Nasab as a presenter, specific information is not readily available in the provided sources. For the most current details on his speaking engagements, it would be advisable to consult academic conference websites, professional networking platforms, or his institutional affiliations. ",

He has a background in physics, neuroscience, and AI, with experience in academia and startups. His career trajectory shows a shift from academic research towards applied AI in industry. No immediate red flags were identified.\n\n### Thematic Summary of Key Findings\n\n**Professional / Career Background**\n\n- Currently employed at Amazon Rufus.\n- Formerly worked at CODA Biotherapeutics (gene therapy startup), Stanford University (Department of Neurosurgery, collaborating with Peter Tass on neurological disorder treatments), and Ohio University (PhD in Physics focusing on excitable tree networks).\n\n**Business & Financial Activity**\n\n- No direct affiliations with companies as officer or director found in public records. CODA Biotherapeutics, his former employer, closed in 2022 due to funding challenges despite raising approximately $70 million.\n\n**Legal or Criminal Mentions**\n\n- No legal proceedings or criminal records found.\n\n**Academic / Public Recognition**\n\n- PhD in Physics from Ohio University.\n- Publications in AI, surface chemistry, catalysis, and neuroscience (including a mini review on AI applications in surface chemistry and catalysis).\n- Presented a colloquium talk at the College of Wooster in 2017 on emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks.\n- Received an APS travel award in 2019.\n- Google Scholar profile available ([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\n\n**Online / Social Presence**\n\n- Personal website: [https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai)\n- Stack Overflow profile (inactive): [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/91388/ali?utm_source=openai](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/91388/ali?utm_source=openai)\n- Potentially associated with a GitHub profile under the username \"imseyed\" (Ali Khalili) which includes repositories related to two-factor authentication and a music player ([https://github.com/imseyed?utm_source=openai](https://github.com/imseyed?utm_source=openai)). It is unclear if this profile truly belongs to the subject.\n- No significant presence found on Twitter or Reddit.\n\n\n**Other Notable Mentions**\n\n- Appears to have transitioned from a more theoretical/academic background in physics and neuroscience to applied AI research and development roles in industry.\n\n\n### Risk Profile\n\nBased on available information, Ali Khaledi Nasab presents a **low reputational risk**. His background appears credible, with academic achievements, publications, and professional experience in reputable institutions.

He earned his Ph.D. in physics from Ohio University, where he focused on the collective dynamics of excitable tree networks. After completing his doctorate, he joined Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery, collaborating with Peter Tass on developing stimulation methods for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease. In 2021, he transitioned to CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup targeting epilepsy treatments. Following the closure of CODA in 2022 due to funding challenges, he joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team. In 2024, he moved to Amazon Rufus to work on generative AI products. Throughout his career, Khaledi-Nasab has published research on nonlinear dynamics, computational neuroscience, and AI, with his work cited in various scientific journals.
