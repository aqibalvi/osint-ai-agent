Originally from Iran, he moved to the United States in 2014 to pursue his Ph.D. After completing his doctoral studies, he joined Stanford University's Department of Neurosurgery as a research scientist. In 2021, he transitioned to CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. Following the closure of CODA in 2022 due to funding challenges, he joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team. In 2024, he moved to Amazon Rufus to work on a new generative AI product. Throughout his career, Khaledi Nasab has been involved in various research projects, including studying the dynamics of excitable tree networks and developing stimulation methods for neurological disorders. He has also contributed to the Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health, which received the 2024 PROSE Award for \"significant contributions\" in Clinical Medicine.

This research investigates the effects of random reset stimulation on neural networks, aiming to achieve long-lasting desynchronization, which is relevant for treating neurological disorders characterized by excessive neuronal synchrony, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. ([patrinum.ch](https://patrinum.ch/record/489579?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2022, he co-authored another study, \"Long-Lasting Desynchronization of Plastic Neuronal Networks by Double-Random Coordinated Reset Stimulation,\" published in *Frontiers in Network Physiology*. This work explores the use of double-random coordinated reset stimulation to induce desynchronization in neuronal networks, offering potential therapeutic applications for conditions associated with abnormal neural synchrony. ([ouci.dntb.gov.ua](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/7WkQJEr7/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, Khaledi Nasab has been involved in outreach and advocacy. In 2017, he authored an article titled \"Standing up to fear,\" published in *Science*. In this piece, he shares his experiences as an international student in the United States, discussing the challenges posed by the political climate and advocating for support for international scholars. ([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32689067/Standing_up_to_fear?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese contributions highlight Khaledi Nasab's dedication to advancing our understanding of neural dynamics and his commitment to supporting the international scientific community.

In 2021, he transitioned to CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. Following the closure of CODA in 2022 due to funding challenges, he joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team. In 2024, he moved to Amazon Rufus to work on a new generative AI product. Throughout his career, Khaledi Nasab has been involved in various research projects, including studying the dynamics of excitable tree networks and developing stimulation methods for neurological disorders. He has also contributed to the Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health, which received the 2024 PROSE Award for \"significant contributions\" in Clinical Medicine.

      "data": "Ali Khaledi Nasab is a doctoral candidate in physics and astronomy at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. In April 2017, he authored an article titled \"Standing up to fear,\" published in *Science* magazine, where he discussed the challenges faced by international students in the U.S. following the Trump administration's first travel ban. In this piece, he highlighted the increased feelings of unwelcomeness and safety concerns among international students, particularly those from Iran, and emphasized the need for institutional support during such uncertain times. ([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32689067/Standing_up_to_fear?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe surname \"Khaledi Nasab\" is of Persian origin, with \"Khaledi\" potentially derived from \"Khaled,\" a common Persian name, and \"Nasab\" meaning \"lineage\" or \"descent.\" This suggests that the name may denote \"descendant of Khaled.\" However, without additional genealogical records, it is challenging to provide a detailed family history for Ali Khaledi Nasab.
