Academic / Public Presence**\n- Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy from Ohio University\n- Research contributions in:\n  - Collective dynamics of excitable tree networks (sensory neurons)³\n  - Green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles using potato extract³\n  - AI applications in healthcare disease diagnosis and prediction²\n  - Systematic review of AI in Middle East healthcare systems²\n- Published article \"Standing up to fear\" (2017) about challenges faced by international students during Trump administration travel ban³⁷\n- Presented \"Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks of excitable elements\" at College of Wooster (October 3, 2017)⁵\n- Received APS Division of Biological Physics 2019 Student Travel Award⁵⁷\n- Presented \"Dynamics of excitable tree networks: Application to sensory neurons\" at 2019 APS Meeting in Boston⁵\n- Google Scholar profile with citations³\n- Published in journals including *Scientific Reports*, *Starch–Stärke*, and *Discover Artificial Intelligence*²³\n\n**5. Online / Social Media**\n- Personal website: alikhaledi.com¹⁷\n- Google Scholar profile³\n- Mentioned in Ohio University's \"Ohio Forum\" for academic achievements⁵\n- Profile on Frontiers Loop network⁸\n\n**6. Patent Activity**\n- No patent registrations found under his name in AI or machine learning domains⁸\n\n**7. Additional Observations**\n- Demonstrates a diverse research background spanning theoretical studies and practical applications\n- Active in addressing social issues affecting international students and scholars\n- Transition from academia to industry shows adaptability and practical application of research skills\n\n### Risk Score\nLow. Ali Khaledi Nasab's profile indicates a strong academic and professional background with no concerning findings. The primary risk would be reputational, stemming from his involvement in AI research and development, particularly generative AI, which can be subject to ethical and societal concerns. However, there is no indication of any specific high-risk behavior or affiliation.\n\n### Missing Investigations\n- Limited information available about specific projects at Amazon Rufus\n- No detailed information about research outcomes at CODA Biotherapeutics\n- Social media presence beyond professional networks not thoroughly investigated\n\n---\n**Citations:**\n1. alikhaledi.com (Task 1)\n2. americaspg.com, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (Task 2)\n3. scholar.google.com, academia.edu (Task 3)\n4. export.arxiv.org (Task 1)\n5. ohio-forum.com (Task 5)\n6. loop.frontiersin.org (Task 1)\n7. alikhaledi.com (Task 7)\n8. loop.frontiersin.org (Task 8)"
