([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAli Khaledi, Ph.D., is a physicist and AI scientist currently working at Amazon Rufus. Originally from Iran, he moved to the United States in 2014 to pursue his Ph.D. After completing his doctorate, he joined the Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford University School of Medicine for a research position. Following his tenure at Stanford, he worked at CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. In October 2022, he joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team and later transitioned to Amazon Rufus in 2024 to work on their latest Generative AI product.\n\nAli's expertise spans physics, neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, signal processing, statistics, biophysics, and network sciences. He is passionate about continuous learning, dedicating two hours daily to reading books and taking courses. In 2024, he was appointed as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Ohio University and gave a colloquium talk at their Department of Physics. Additionally, he served as the editor for the Brain Development section of the \"Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health,\" which received the 2024 PROSE Award for significant contributions in Clinical Medicine by the Association of American Publishers.\n\nFor more detailed information about his work and achievements, you can visit his personal website.

This research investigates the impact of random dynamical interventions on reducing polarization within networked systems, providing insights into mitigating echo chambers in social networks. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, Khaledi-Nasab co-authored \"Impact of number of stimulation sites on long-lasting desynchronization effects of coordinated reset stimulation,\" published in *Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science* in 2020. This study examines how varying the number of stimulation sites affects the efficacy of coordinated reset stimulation in achieving sustained desynchronization in neural networks. ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ash32BAAAAAJ&utm_source=openai))\n\nThese publications highlight Khaledi-Nasab's contributions to understanding and manipulating neural network dynamics through AI methodologies, with implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in neuroscience and beyond.

([alikhaledi.com](https://www.alikhaledi.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAli Khaledi, Ph.D., is a physicist and AI scientist currently working at Amazon Rufus. Originally from Iran, he moved to the United States in 2014 to pursue his Ph.D. After completing his doctorate, he joined the Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford University School of Medicine for a research position. Following his tenure at Stanford, he worked at CODA Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup focused on developing treatments for epilepsy. In October 2022, he joined Amazon as a research scientist in the AWS network capacity team and later transitioned to Amazon Rufus in 2024 to work on their latest Generative AI product.\n\nAli's expertise spans physics, neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, signal processing, statistics, biophysics, and network sciences. He is passionate about continuous learning, dedicating two hours daily to reading books and taking courses. In 2024, he was appointed as an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Ohio University and gave a colloquium talk at their Department of Physics. Additionally, he served as the editor for the Brain Development section of the \"Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health,\" which received the 2024 PROSE Award for significant contributions in Clinical Medicine by the Association of American Publishers.\n\nFor more detailed information about his work and achievements, you can visit his personal website.
