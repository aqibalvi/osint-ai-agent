([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2017/10/khaledi-nasab-gives-colloquium-talk-college-wooster/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn March 2019, Khaledi-Nasab received a Student Travel Award from the American Physical Society's Division of Biological Physics, enabling him to present his research at the APS annual meeting in Boston. His presentation, \"Dynamics of Excitable Tree Networks: Application to Sensory Neurons,\" delved into the dynamical principles of sensory neurons with tree-like morphologies, such as those found in muscle spindles and mechanoreceptors. He utilized theoretical and computational approaches to explore spike generation and information coding in these neurons. ([ohio-forum.com](https://www.ohio-forum.com/2019/05/khaledi-nasab-receives-aps-travel-award-to-attend-conference/?utm_source=openai))\n\nBeyond these presentations, Khaledi-Nasab has an extensive publication record, with 23 papers and 426 citations, reflecting his significant contributions to the field. ([exaly.com](https://exaly.com/author/5034433/ali-khaledi-nasab?utm_source=openai))\n\nCurrently, he serves as a Senior Researcher at Amazon in Seattle and is also affiliated with the Ronin Institute in Essex County, United States.
