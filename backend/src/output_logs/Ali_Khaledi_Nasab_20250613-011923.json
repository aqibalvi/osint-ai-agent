Here are two notable publications:\n\n1. **\"Variability of collective dynamics in random tree networks of strongly-coupled stochastic excitable elements\"** (2018): This study examines the collective behavior of strongly coupled excitable elements arranged in random tree networks. By modeling sensory neurons with branched myelinated terminals, the authors analyze how structural variability in these networks influences the spike train statistics of the root node. They present a statistical description of random tree networks and demonstrate that, under strong coupling conditions, the collective response variability is determined by the joint probability distribution of the total number of leaves and nodes. ([web3.arxiv.org](https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/1808.02750?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **\"Depolarization of echo chambers by random dynamical nudge\"** (2021): In this paper, the authors address the formation of echo chambers in social networks, where users engage predominantly with like-minded individuals, leading to political fragmentation and social polarization. They introduce a feedback mechanism called random dynamical nudge (RDN), which presents each agent with input from a random selection of other agents' opinions. Their computational results suggest that RDN effectively prevents the formation of echo chambers and promotes a neutral consensus, making it a potential strategy for social media platforms to mitigate online community segregation on complex social issues.

Here are two notable publications:\n\n1. **\"Variability of collective dynamics in random tree networks of strongly-coupled stochastic excitable elements\"** (2018): This study examines the collective behavior of strongly coupled excitable elements arranged in random tree networks. By modeling sensory neurons with branched myelinated terminals, the authors analyze how structural variability in these networks influences the spike train statistics of the root node. They present a statistical description of random tree networks and demonstrate that, under strong coupling conditions, the collective response variability is determined by the joint probability distribution of the total number of leaves and nodes. ([web3.arxiv.org](https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/1808.02750?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **\"Depolarization of echo chambers by random dynamical nudge\"** (2021): In this paper, the authors address the formation of echo chambers in social networks, where users engage predominantly with like-minded individuals, leading to political fragmentation and social polarization. They introduce a feedback mechanism called random dynamical nudge (RDN), which presents each agent with input from a random selection of other agents' opinions. Their computational results suggest that RDN effectively prevents the formation of echo chambers and promotes a neutral consensus, making it a potential strategy for social media platforms to mitigate online community segregation on complex social issues.
