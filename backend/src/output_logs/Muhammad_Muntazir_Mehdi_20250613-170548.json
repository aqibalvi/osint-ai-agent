The research aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among orthopedic trauma patients. The study found that these patients often experience emotional disorders, with anxiety and depression levels increasing after surgery.

    "revised_report": "## OSINT Intelligence Report: Muhammad Muntazir Mehdi\n\n**Report Date:** June 13, 2025\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nMuhammad Muntazir Mehdi is a software development professional with expertise in cloud computing and AI systems. Based on available evidence, he previously worked at Microsoft for over eight years as a Principal Engineering Manager and Principal Development and Data Engineering Lead, before joining Amazon as a Software Development Manager in Media Planning¬π. Due to name similarities, care must be taken to distinguish this individual from other researchers with similar names.\n\n### Key Intelligence by Category\n\n**1. Career / Employment**\n\n* Previously employed at Microsoft for 8+ years in senior engineering roles¬π\n* Contributed to simulator and AI platform used by Microsoft Azure¬π\n* Developed commercial and ecosystem platforms for container-based AI¬π\n* Currently or recently employed at Amazon as Software Development Manager in Media Planning¬π\n* Listed as speaker at Data Science Dojo¬π\n* Self-described as software architect with 9+ years experience in cloud-native solutions¬≤\n\n**2. Financial / Corporate Ties**\n\n* No specific financial irregularities or concerning corporate relationships identified\n* Employment history limited to major technology companies (Microsoft, Amazon)\n\n**3. Legal / Regulatory Issues**\n\n* No legal or regulatory issues identified in available sources\n\n**4. Academic / Public Presence**\n\n* Personal website: mehdibukhari.github.io¬≤\n* Note: Medical research publications found under similar names (Muhammad Muntazir Mehdi) appear to belong to different individuals and cannot be reliably attributed to this subject\n\n**5. Online / Social Media**\n\n* GitHub profile 'MehdiKhosa50' shows blockchain and JavaScript projects¬≤\n* Stack Overflow presence under 'Muhammad Mehdi' with 532 reputation points¬≤\n* Verification needed to confirm these profiles belong to the same individual\n\n**6. Additional Observations**\n\n* Multiple individuals with the name Muhammad Muntazir Mehdi exist in academic and professional contexts\n* Evidence suggests at least one medical researcher and one technology professional share similar names\n* Dr. Muntazir Hussain mentioned in some search results is a different person entirely\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\n**Risk Level: LOW**\n\nThe subject appears to be a legitimate technology professional with standard career progression through major technology companies. No evidence of criminal activity, regulatory violations, or reputational concerns was identified. The primary challenge in assessment is distinguishing between multiple individuals with similar names.\n\n### Footnotes\n¬π Data Science Dojo speaker profile\n¬≤ Personal website and GitHub profile (verification of ownership pending)"

      "data": "Muhammad Muntazir Mehdi has contributed to several scholarly works across diverse fields. Notable publications include:\n\n1. **Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression among Orthopedic Trauma Inpatients**: This study, co-authored with Waleed Ali, Muhammad Fahim Qasim, Adil Saidullah, Rizwan Farooq, and Abid Munir, was published in the *Pakistan Journal of Medical & Health Sciences*. The research aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among orthopedic trauma patients. The study found that these patients often experience emotional disorders, with anxiety and depression levels increasing after surgery. The authors suggest that clinicians should closely monitor geriatric patients for these psychological issues. ([pjmhsonline.com](https://pjmhsonline.com/index.php/pjmhs/article/view/3875?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Disparities in Liver Transplantation Rates and Outcomes Among Adults with and Without Mental Illnesses**: Co-authored with Usama Waqar, Selamawit Woldesenbet, Muhammad Musaab Munir, Yutaka Endo, Erryk Katayama, Vivian Resende, Mujtaba Khalil, Karol Rawicz-Pruszy≈Ñski, and Parit Mavani, this article was published in the *Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery*. The study examined the rates of evaluation, transplantation, and post-transplant outcomes among patients with and without mental illnesses. The findings revealed that patients with mental illnesses had lower rates of evaluation and transplantation but did not experience significant differences in postoperative outcomes compared to those without mental illnesses. ([ecommons.aku.edu](https://ecommons.aku.edu/pakistan_fhs_mc_mc/378/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Variations in Medicare Reimbursements Among Surgical Oncologists Who Are US Versus International Medical Graduates**: In this research, co-authored with Abdullah Altaf, Mujtaba Khalil, Sidharth Iyer, Razeen Thamachack, Zayed Rashid, Timothy M. Pawlik, and Abdul Hadi Shahid, the authors analyzed variations in practice metrics and billing practices among US Medical Graduates (USMGs) and International Medical Graduates (IMGs) in surgical oncology. The study found that IMGs provided more procedural services, cared for patients with higher average risk scores, and performed a greater variety of procedures compared to USMGs. Consequently, IMGs had higher mean annual charges, payment-per-service, and charge-per-service amounts.
